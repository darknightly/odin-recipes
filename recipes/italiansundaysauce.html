        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Italian Sunday Sauce (also known as Sunday Gravy) is a rich,
            slow-cooked tomato sauce that embodies the warmth and tradition of
            Italian family gatherings. Made with a hearty mix of meats—such as
            meatballs, Italian sausage, pork ribs, or beef braciole—this sauce
            simmers for hours, allowing the flavors to meld into a deep, savory,
            and slightly sweet masterpiece. Aromatic garlic, onions, and herbs
            like basil and oregano infuse the tomato base, creating a comforting
            aroma that fills the home. Typically served over pasta and enjoyed
            with crusty bread, Sunday Sauce isn’t just a meal—it’s a celebration
            of family, patience, and love passed down through generations.

            <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree</li>

            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

            <li>7 cups water</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste</li>

            <li>1 bay leaf</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>

            <li>12 large cooked meatballs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle neck bones on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>
                Heat 4 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot or
                Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place neck bones in the pot
                and cook for 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a
                plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add sausage links to the drippings and brown for 3 minutes on
                each side, adding remaining oil as needed. Set aside with the
                pork.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add onion to the drippings and season with salt. Cook, stirring
                often, until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>
                Add tomato puree and crushed tomatoes, then add water and sugar;
                cook, stirring constantly, until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add bay leaf. Rub basil and oregano between your fingers to
                release their aroma and add to the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice sausages into large chunks and return to the pot with the
                neck bones; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add meatballs, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring
                occasionally, for 4 to 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove neck bones and bay leaf. Remove any meat remaining on the
                bones, shred it, and return to the sauce.
            </li>
