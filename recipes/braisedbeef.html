            <h2>What Is Braised Beef?</h2>
            Braising is a cooking method that involves
            slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. In
            the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef
            broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires
            less liquid.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>

            <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>

            <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>

            <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>

            <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>

            <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>

            <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>

            <li>1 cup red wine</li>

            <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>

            <li>2 bay leaves</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>

            <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C).</li>
            <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3&frac12; teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium-high and cook, undisturbed, until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted, add onion, mushrooms, and carrots and cook 5 minutes, stirring often and scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more browned bits from the pan.</li>
            <li>Return the meat to the pan, along with any accumulated juices, and add thyme, bay leaves, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour in beef broth—just enough that it comes up about two-thirds of the way up on the beef (do not fully submerge the meat in liquid). Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover and place in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender, 2 to 2&frac12; hours.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, serve, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
